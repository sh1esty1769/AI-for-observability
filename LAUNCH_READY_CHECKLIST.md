## ⏳ Blocking Launch (1-2 hours)

### ~~1. Real Dashboard Screenshot~~ ✅ DONE!
**Status: COMPLETED**

Screenshot added! Dashboard looks professional with:
- Modern light mode UI
- Sidebar navigation
- Stats cards with metrics
- Agent cards with details
- Activity feed
- @2x resolution (2.7 MB)

---

### 2. GIF Demo (1 hour)
**Priority: CRITICAL**

```bash
cd argus
python scripts/screenshot_helper.py
```

**Steps:**
1. Script loads demo data
2. Opens dashboard at localhost:3001
3. Take screenshot (Cmd+Shift+4, Space, click browser)
4. Save as: `assets/dashboard-preview.png`
5. Update README.md line 25 (replace placeholder)
6. Commit and push

**Why critical:** Placeholder screenshots kill trust. This alone could add 200-300 stars.

---

### 2. GIF Demo (1 hour)
**Priority: CRITICAL**

**Option A: QuickTime + ezgif.com**
1. Open QuickTime Player
2. File → New Screen Recording
3. Record 15-30 seconds:
   - Show code with `@watch.agent` decorator
   - Run the script
   - Show dashboard updating
4. Export as .mov
5. Convert to GIF: https://ezgif.com/video-to-gif
6. Save as: `assets/demo.gif`

**Option B: Kap (better quality)**
```bash
brew install --cask kap
# Record and export as GIF
```

**Update README:**
- Add GIF after hero section
- Show it in Features section

**Why critical:** Shows how easy it is. Converts visitors to users.

---

### 3. PyPI Package (2 hours)
**Priority: CRITICAL**

```bash
# 1. Create PyPI account
# https://pypi.org/account/register/

# 2. Install tools
pip install build twine

# 3. Update setup.py
# - Check version (0.1.0)
# - Check author email
# - Check dependencies

# 4. Build
python -m build

# 5. Upload
python -m twine upload dist/*

# 6. Test
pip install argus
```

**Update README:**
- Change installation from `git+https://...` to `pip install argus`

**Why critical:** Makes installation frictionless. Removes barrier to entry.

## 🎯 Ready to Launch (After above 3 items)

### Week 1: Soft Launch

**Day 1-2: Reddit**
- [ ] Post on r/Python (1.3M members)
- [ ] Post on r/MachineLearning (2.8M members)
- [ ] Post on r/LangChain (50K members)
- [ ] Post on r/LocalLLaMA (200K members)

**Template:**
```
Title: "I built an open-source observability tool for AI agents (caught a $847 bug)"

Body:
Hey r/Python! 👋

I'm a 17-year-old developer and I just launched Argus - an open-source 
observability tool for AI agents.

**The problem:** AI agents are expensive black boxes. One of my agents 
went into an infinite loop and burned $847 in 11 minutes (GPT-4 calling 
itself 2,341 times).

**The solution:** Argus tracks your agents with one decorator:

[CODE EXAMPLE]

**Features:**
- Automatic cost tracking (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere)
- Agent loop detection
- LangChain integration
- <1ms overhead
- 100% self-hosted (your data never leaves your machine)

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **ЕГЭ First:** Don't spend more than 30 min/day on Argus
2. **Build in Public:** Tweet progress daily (@maxcodesai)
3. **Respond Fast:** Reply to issues/PRs within 24h
4. **Quality > Quantity:** Better to have 1 great feature than 10 mediocre
5. **Listen to Users:** They'll tell you what they need
6. **Be Patient:** 1000 stars takes 2-3 months, not 1 week

## 🚀 Next Action

**Right now, run this:**

```bash
cd argus
python scripts/screenshot_helper.py
```

Follow the instructions, take the screenshot, and you're 90% ready to launch! 🎉
